# 📘 Project: Zephyr & Research Mate  

## 🔹 Overview  
This repository contains two AI-powered projects developed in Google Colab:  

- **Zephyr** → Fine-tuning the model Zephyr7B to be able to respond legal queries better.  
- **Research Mate** → An AI-powered research assistant that helps retrieve, summarize, and manage academic papers.  

Both notebooks are designed to be run seamlessly in **Google Colab** or locally with **Jupyter Notebook**.
